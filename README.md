# A-mobile-application-to-improve-nutritional-awareness-for-students-using-NFC


Nutritional awareness defined as self-perception inclined to eating balanced diet. A good nutrition is a part
of leading a healthy lifestyle. A well-defined diet can reduce risks of chronic diseases. Technology is a big

aspects alongside the popular comparison use of barcode scanners. An interesting comparison is
thoroughly explored. This study aims to present, research, test, develop aiming to improve nutritional
awareness for University of Greenwich students using Near Field Communication (NFC). NFC tags are
used to store, read, write, and update information that is gained using Nutritionix Application
Programming Interface (API). Nutritionix is the largest verified database by over 5M consumers use of
queries every month. A verified database that explores reach beyond supermarket products and even aims
to search for products within the restaurant, and common items too. A verified database, such as
Nutritionix, is exactly the type of API that is needed to be selected to use and store information using NFC
tags. A positive outlook to gain updated information from a verified source. A result of developing an
android application to increase nutritional awareness.
